## SDOT Problem Solving Repository

### Introduction
Welcome to the SDOT (Super Dream Offer Training) Problem Solving Repository! This repository contains a collection of problems that I have learned and solved during my training at the CDC (Career Development Center) office of VIT-AP University, under the expert guidance of Varun Sir.

### About SDOT
SDOT, short for Super Dream Offer Training, is a comprehensive training program designed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge required to excel in technical interviews and competitive programming challenges. The program covers a wide range of topics including data structures, algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and more.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to document my journey of learning and solving problems during the SDOT training. By sharing my solutions, I hope to not only showcase my problem-solving abilities but also provide a valuable resource for other students who are undergoing similar training or preparing for technical interviews.

### Contents
The repository is organized into different folders, each focusing on a specific topic or problem-solving technique. Within each folder, you will find a collection of problems along with their solutions implemented in various programming languages.

### Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have solved a problem differently or have encountered a new problem that you think would be beneficial to include, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a comprehensive resource for aspiring programmers and interviewees.
